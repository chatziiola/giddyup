# gdrive-tools

This is actually my **first** *exercise* in Python Programming. I had to find a way to automate the process of uploading my ebooks to my google drive and that is essentially what this is about.

## Usage
Simply edit the file with your editor of choice and make sure that you have set the path to your local directory. After that:
`python giddyup.py`
